# AutoCiteV2
Version 2 of the AutoCitation written in python. This time featuring a WebUI Interface. Gone of the days of constantly needing to open a text editor, paste in your websites, save it, run the python script, and then open the references file just to get your refrences, now you can have everything in one place.
